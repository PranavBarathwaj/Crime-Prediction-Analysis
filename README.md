# Crime-Prediction-Analysis

The project sets out to develop an automated system capable of categorizing crime 
descriptions into specific predefined categories. By leveraging the power of machine learning techniques 
and PySpark's feature extraction capabilities, the aim is to streamline the classification process and enhance 
the efficiency of crime incident management for the SFPD.
